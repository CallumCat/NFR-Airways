![ReasonForOpenSourcing](https://northamericanfurryclan.ga/images/48757605.png)

I had been hosting this Discord bot for a user on Discord for a long time, before the bot was rendered obsolete as the group got shut down and Discord.js got forced to v12 (which made v11.5.1 bots obsolete), and I decided to release the bot to the public for you guys to edit to your likings. I personally don't care what you do with it as long as you follow the attached license. Please, don't sell this, even if the license allows it, it's just scummy to sell somebody else's code. Thank you.

This bot includes RoVer commands which can be used for ROBLOX verification in Discord and includes several different command modules and can have commands easily added to be used with your community.

If you need support for this bot, I will not provide, however, you can join Discord's official API server or the Discord.js Official Server for help.

If anybody wants to do pull requests for dependency upgrades/a complete discord v12 overhaul for the entire bot, you're welcome to do so, and I'll review and accept all legit Pull Requests.

Please utilize the Issues section for reporting any issues you find with the bot, and do Pull Requests for fixes. I will not provide support for this bot, however, other users are more than welcome to commit to this project and update stuff as needed.
